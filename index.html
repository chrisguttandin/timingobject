        This specification defines a timing object and an associated API. The timing object is a local object that may be used by Web clients to ensure precisely timed execution. If multiple time-sensitive components take direction from the same timing object, their behaviour will be precisely coordinated in time. Crucially, this is also the case in distributed settings. A central motivation for the timing object is that it may be connected to an online timing resource. This way, the local timing object is basis for precisely timed operations, both in single-device as well as multi-device scenarios. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Synchronized playback of multi-device linear media is an important use-case for multi-device timing. However, multi-device timing has wide utility for a variety of timing related challenges, including distributed media control and remote control, distributed synchronization, distributed time-shifting, distibuted time-ordering and distributed recording (time-stamping). The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/">W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group</a> works to extend the Web with support for multi-device timing, and the timing object is the central concept in this initiative.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Timing mechanisms allow operations to be executed at the correct time. The Web already has several mechanisms supporting timed operations, including setTimeout and setInterval, as well as controllers for media frameworks and animations. Unfortunately, these mechanisms are limited in scope, as they only apply to operations within a single web page. In contrast, a multi-device timing mechanism would allow precisely timed operations across Web pages hosted by different devices. The W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group has been formed with the goal of extending the Web with native support for precisely timed operation in the multi-device scenario.

      <h5>The HTMLTimingObject</h5>

      <h5>Single-device Linear Composition</h5>
      <p>
        Composition as a design principle is a hallmark of the Web, yet support for composition does not fully extend to linear media. For instance, imagine a linear presentation made from a HTML5 video, some timed meta-information, a SMIL component, a WebAnimation, a map with timed georeferenced data, and a timed Twitter widget. The idea would be to have these compoenents play together to form a single storyline. If this was easy, it would imply that classical benefits of composition would be much more available for linear media; reusability, extensibility, flexibility and mashup-ability. Unfortunately, it is not easy. There is currently little interoperability between linear components and framwork. The HTMLMediaController supports linear composition of HTML5MediaElements, but that's about it. The problem is related to timing. Each linear framework solves timing and timing control in its own custom way, and this implies that coordination and synchronization of heterogeneous linear components becomes hard work, if at all possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We propose the HTMLTimingObject as a basis for linear composition in the single device scenario.
      </p>
      <h5>Multi-device Linear Composition</h5>
      <p>
      Linear composition extends naturally to the multi-device scenario. We would like to build multi-device linear media by scattering or duplicating linear components across connected devices:

      <p>
        This specification aims to make it possible and easy to synchronize playback of media (and non-media) content across Web clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, the specification introduces a timing object that is essentially an ideal clock, advancing deterministically in accordance with a system clock. In this context, <em>ideal</em> means that it should take exactly 2.0 seconds for the <code>currentTime</code> property of the timing object to advance from 3.0 to 5.0 when its <code>playbackRate</code> is 1.0. The deterministic behavior is required for reliable distributed synchronization.
      </p>
      <p>
        A timing object may be associated with an online timing resource that represents various application-level timing concepts, such as clocks, timeouts, stop-watches or media controllers. Timing resources are true objects on the Web, identified by URLs and hosted by timing services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the timing object is associated with an online timing resources, the timing object acts as a proxy object, mediating access to the online timing resource. This way, control operations such as <em>play</em> or <em>pause</em> are forwarded to the timing service. Effects can then be propagated equally to all connected clients. The timing object fully encapsulates the complexity of multi-device operation and leaves the programmer to interact only with local objects.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <a href="#fig-multi-device-synchronization-architecture"></a> illustrates three Web clients hosted by three different devices, say a laptop, a smartphone and a tablet. These three Web clients each have a timing object connected to a single, online, multi-device timing resource. For example, the online timing resource could be used as basis for shared media control, allowing multiple clients to operate in synchrony. This way, a laptop could present a video, the smartphone could present the audio track, and the tablet could present controls, progressbar, and timed extra information. If the timing resource is requested to pause, all connected clients pause in unison.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        The protocol used to connect, synchronize and interact with online timing resources will be defined in a separate specification.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Similarly, the integration of the timing object with HTML5 Media Elements [[HTML5]] is out of scope of this specification.

      <h2>Timing objects</h2>

      <p>A <dfn>timing object</dfn> represents an ideal clock that advances deterministically in accordance with a local or online system clock.</p>

      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> has an <dfn>internal motion</dfn> represented by a <a>media state vector</a>, which must initially be set to <code>(p<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>0</sub>)</code> where <code>p<sub>0</sub>=0.0</code>, <code>v<sub>0</sub>=0.0</code>, <code>a<sub>0</sub>=0.0</code> and where <code>t<sub>0</sub></code> is the local timestamp when the object is created.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <a>timing object</a> maintains an <dfn>internal synchronization state</dfn> that contains an estimate of the current client's clock skew relative to the online timing service when the object is associated with an <a>online timing resource</a>, as well as an estimate of the current network latency between the client and the online timing service. This information is used to correct timestamp values when <a title="media state vector">media state vectors</a> are exchanged between the client and the timing service. The user agent must initialize the skew and latency to 0.0. If the <a>timing object</a> is not associated with an online timing service, the skew and latency remain at 0.0.

The parameters for the update operation are optional, i.e., null values may be supplied. This provides a simple mechanism for tying movements together. The idea is to allow one aspect of the movement to be updated while preserving the others. For instance, <code>update(null, value, null)</code> means "update velocity while preserving position and acceleration". Note that the values we want to preserve are not from the internal state, but rather from a snapshot of the <a>MediaStateVector</a> that represents the <a>internal motion</a>, taken at exactly the time when the update is processed.

          <li>Let <em>timing</em> be a newly constructed <code><a>Timing</a></code> object.</li>
